A personal project aimed at learning and showcasing the core concepts of Machine Learning by building algorithms from scratch using NumPy, and showcasing their usage. 

My goal is to understand myself and help others understand the mathematics and logic behind these algorithms deeply, rather than just using high level frameworks. This repository serves as a documented learning project, from basic models to more complex ones.

## 🚀 Purpose & Features

-   **Showcase of Work**: Demonstrating a fundamental understanding of ML algorithms.
-   **Educational**: Code is written to be readable and instructive, helping others understand the mechanics under the hood.
-   **From Scratch**: No black box libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow for the core logic.
-   **Progressive Learning**: Starting with simple models (Linear Regression, Perceptron) and evolving to more advanced topics.
-   **Interactive Demos**: Jupyter notebooks provided for each model to visualize performance and straightforward usage.
