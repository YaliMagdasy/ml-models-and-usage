# Source Code

This directory (`src`) contains the core implementations of machine learning algorithms (from scratch), utility modules, and centralized library management.

## 📂 Directory Structure

* **`classification/`**: Implementations of models for categorical targets.
* **`regression/`**: Implementations of models for continuous targets.
* **`clustering/`**: Implementations of models for data grouping.
* **`shared/`**: The internal API. Handles utilities and centralizes standard imports (`numpy` as `np`, `pandas` as `pd`, `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`) for all projects.
